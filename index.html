                <p class="developer__info">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of
                    the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use
                    JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All
                    major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

                <p class="qa__info">Quality assurance (QA) is the term used in both manufacturing and service industries
                    to describe the systematic efforts taken to assure that the product(s) delivered to customer(s) meet
                    with the contractual and other agreed upon performance, design, reliability, and maintainability
                    expectations of that customer. The core purpose of Quality Assurance is to prevent mistakes and
                    defects in the development and production of both manufactured products, such as automobiles and
                    shoes, and delivered services, such as automotive repair and athletic shoe design. Assuring quality
                    and therefore avoiding problems and delays when delivering products or services to customers.</p>
